# Whatsapp-exporter

Simple project to export your WhatsApp messages to a JSON file.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Just run `node index.js` and scan the QR code. The rest will be done automatically.
It will be completely done when you see `Done archiving chats` in the console.
But you can also manually stop the process at any time by pressing Ctrl+C(it saves
after each chat archive).
